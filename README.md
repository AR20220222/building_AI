# smart glasses

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Smart glasses with teleprompter-style augmented reality display with a built-in chatbot that understands spoken language and suggests an appropriate response depending on the current environment, history of interaction with a particular person, and own speech patterns and vocabulary


## Background

Ever since hearing about Google Glass in 2013 I’ve been thinking how a wearable smart eyewear device can be used to help people’s lives. Google Glass has not been a huge success due to high cost and limitations of technology back then, but the it is still used on enterprise market. It’s applications are however underwhelming. More contemporary devices like OPPO Air Glass that is announced in 2021 offers display of information in the field of vision, translation between English and Mandarin, “adaptive” teleprompter and some sort of AR assist for walk and bike navigation.

What if the “smart glasses” could be even smarter with AI functions?

*I think I am not the only person in the world that struggles to remember the names of the people I meet especially during networking events. It would be handy if I could scan the details of a business card by looking at it and associating them with the face of the person. 

*Another useful application could be a smart teleprompter/chatbot hybrid that assists in real-time conversations. This could be especially useful in situations where interactions roughly follow a script, like networking and sales meetings.

*This product can benefit people with dementia


## How is it used?

The user base for such a product should be very wide in order to make the product cheap enough for mass adoption. Also, wide use of the product should also help to instill a public acceptance of someone with a wearable device with the ability to record every interaction.

Recognition of people, keeping track of what has been said by this person, and suggesting responses would be the features very useful for dementia patients

## Data sources and AI methods

The task of processing a natural language is very demanding and most likely will involve recurrent neural networks and transformers

## Challenges

Technical challenges of real-time NLP
Public acceptance of devices that record environment

## What next?
